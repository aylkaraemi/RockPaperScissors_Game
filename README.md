# Rock Paper Scissors Game

### Project for the Udacity Intro to Programming Nanodegree

This command line rock paper scissors game allows the user to play either a single game against a radomly chosen computer character or a tournament against five other computer characters. It supports five different variants of rock paper scissors (including Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock) and provides instructions for each variant to the user if needed.
It was built as part of the Udacity Intro to Programming Nanodegree as a test of object oriented programming skills.

## Dependencies
### Python
The rock paper scissors game was written in python3 and some features of the code are not compatible with python2. 
To download python click [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and select a python3 version to install.

_Note_: The site should detect the OS, but if not there are links to the installers for each OS directly below the button for the latest version.

Once the installer is downloaded, run it and follow the instructions to install.

### Shell Environment
For Mac or Linux systems the built-in terminal program can be used.

For Windows you will need to download a program, such as Git Bash, if you do not already have one. 
You can download Git Bash [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and find information on how to use it [here](https://git-scm.com/doc).

## Running the Game
Open your shell program and navigate to the directory you have saved the rps.py file to. 
Enter the command `python rps.py` and the game will start with a query for your name.
